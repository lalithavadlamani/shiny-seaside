# Demographic Analysis

## Participant Attendence

### Attendence by Age

The plot below describes attendance to Seaside events by age group. Primary participants (those who completed the pre-event survey) may have also recorded age groups of secondary participants of those who attended the event's with them. The individuals are included in the visualisation below.

Note: Participants who choose not to disclose their age were omitted.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
params$v1 %>% ggplotly()
```
:::


### Attendence by Indigenous Origin 

The plot below describes participant attendance at each event by whether they are of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander descent.

::: {.superbigimage}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
params$v7 %>% ggplotly()
```
:::

### Attendence by Location

The map visualisation highlights the attendance of participants at Seaside events by their the place of residence (postcode).The plot also allows the filtering participants who have attended a scavenge previously.

# KPI Analysis

<!-- The KPI values shown below in the visualisation are derived as follows: -->

<!-- Each individual is designated a value for each KPI. This is calculated with the formula: -->

<!-- $$\text{KPI} = \frac{\text{Targeted Responses (Learning KPI) + Targeted Responses(Action KPI) + Targeted Responses (Community KPI)}}{3 \times \text{Total Respondents}}$$ -->


## Overall KPI Measures

### Action, Learning and Community KPI's

The visualisation shows the KPI scores for Action, Learning and Community separately. 

::: {.superbigimage}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,echo=FALSE}
params$v3 %>% ggplotly()
```
:::


### Aggregate KPI's by Location

The visualisation aggregates the Action, Learning and Community KPI's and averages them. This average score is then shown by event location on the map below.  

::: {.superbigimage}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
params$v4 
```
:::


## Demographic KPI's 

This section includes a more nuanced analysis of KPI measures by incorporating demographic information such as whether participants have attended a scavenge before and KPI's by participant location.

### Aggregate KPI's by Previous Attendance

This visualisation calculates the average KPI scores for individuals who have and haven't attended a scavenge before separately. This provides insights on whether individuals who have attended scavenges before are demonstrating positive pro-environment behaviour. Those who have not attended a scavenge may have the highest propensity to change. So this visualisation also allows the impact on this marginal population to be measured.

::: {.superbigimage}
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
params$v5 %>% ggplotly()
```
:::


### KPI's by Participant Location

This visualisation calculates the average KPI scores, creating an overall KPI measure. This measure is then highlighted by participant location in the map below. This gives insights into whether participants from certain regions are more likely to demonstrate behavioural change. Future scavenge events can be then augmented accordingly to consolidate differences in behavioural change by participant location to cater to a wider demographic.
