## File Naming Convention

[Location Name]\_[Date (Format: DD.MM.YYYY)]\_[Form Type (Pre/Post)]\_[Event Type (Participants/Volunteers)]

Examples:

* Bondi Junction_03.02.2021_Pre_Participants

    * In this example, use a space if there are two words in the location. Make sure you do not use an underscore in the location name (e.g. Bondi_Junction_03.02.2021_Pre_Participants)

Important things to note:

* The underscore is incredibly important in separating the different fields in this file name. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
* Extra fields can be potentially added
